Movement Modifier: 0.35
-----------
Saturation based on types:
-----------
Raw meat: 0.6 | raw fish & rabbit 0.3 = small

MOBS
----------------------------------------------------------
New Friendly/Neutral Mobs TODO (Do spawn chances well, don't make them spawn too much, especially birds and critters),
all of these animals uses (Some placable item, or automation, etc., ALL MUST BE LEADABLE AND SEATABLE IN BOATS MINECARTS):
-----------
ND -   (Placeable Animal Trophy for finding all animals?)
ND - Deer (Forests of all types | Drops meat & antlers that can be turned into bone meal or some like headpiece and wall ornament)
ND - Bear- (spawn with certain chance near natural honey trees | or perhaps just in forests maybe specific ones | If special lie down and fight back traits not possible, then give them honey to chill em out)
ND -   Brown Bear (Lie Down, If you crouch and stop moving, it chills out, otherwise nah ur dead)
ND -   Black Bear (Fight Back, If you don't run away but rather bring out an attack weapon, it runs away, otherwise nah ur dead)

ND - Alligator (Rivers and Swamps | drops scales for some sort of tough item(Shield? Weapon? or other other pack adds function))

ND - Elephant (Savannah | Tameable | drops something)
ND - Meerkat (Desert | Gives you items for another item & something else)
ND - Firefly (Swamps & Grasslands | drop glowstone dust in small amounts when killed | can be captured in a bottle to craft a lantern or something?)
ND - (Penguin? if not in the other pack with the mob vote mobs, will suggest that pack with this prob)
Birds - (Only one type is chosen when any instance of them are spawned by random | make nests on nearest tree when bred or something? | they might go sit in bird baths or seomthing | Friendable but not tameable for most)
ND -   (Placeable Bird trophy for finding all birds and/or birds will drop items into a new container i add when placed within some amount of blocks of a bird bath with a bird feeder thing | birdhouse cool too 2 live in any house (up to 3 extra for babies) (not super op drops but decent))

Fish - Put rarities and biome based spawning and stuff (Placeable fishing trophy for finding all fish)
(Placeable fish barrel that auto collects fish you catch near it into it until it is full or something, so they dont flop around)
(Or have a special fishing rod state for any fish that is currently on it that has to be right clicked into a barrel?)
(Change villager trades to trade any type of fish for emeralds and add more cooked fish variant trades)
(Random fish will appear under the water and swim towards hook; instead of ONLY bubbles will have both!)
(Fish fillet made of any fish | The 2 or 3 SUPER rare fish will give like golden apple or enchanted golden apple effect when combined with gold nuggets)

ND -   Bass
ND -   Catfish

Existing Friendly/Neutral Mob Tweaks TODO:
-----------
ND - Polar Bears almost always aggressive and move a lot faster
ND - Dead tamed animals drop their collar with their name on it as a memento
-----------
ND - Hostile Mob Progression System:
-----------
Mobs Progress based on either days played or how far you have progressed
(gone to nether, gone to end, got diamond, beat wither?, beat end dragon? or something)
Chooseable option with a little add-on options item, default will be day based maybe
could even make the mobs spawn based on the closest player's items and tool's "points" - create point
system for every single attack item + its enchants and add ranges if bedrock allows for it

----------------------------------------------------------
MISC
----------------------------------------------------------
Item Tooltips TODO:
-----------
Add item data such as durability and saturation & hunger fill
-----------
Fishing Tweaks:
-----------
Rarity Based Fishing
Location based random loot pools ( better items in either deeper water or deep ocean biome)
-----------
SFX for environments (Use music that will play often in biomes if there there is no other way):
-----------
Lots of these sounds should come from the new mobs
Rain Sounds
Swamp gurgles and stuff
Passive Wind sounds when no block is within some amount of blocks above you if you cannot detect being inside
Beach waves
Desert - Random Click sounds to show how dead the place is(no wind)
-----------
Shear Glow Berries & Sugarcane & Kelp & Bamboo to stop growth ( Visual Indicator maybe)
-----------
-----------
Bird Viewing Book or checklist thing maybe in villagers, each bird might give you something if
you touch them with a certain item or lure them in Birds drop claws that are used in something, super rare bird claws can be combined with something for a cool potion effect:
-----------
-----------
Tool that gives you options for each and every small thing in the pack
(turn on/off new animal spawns, turn on/off/different types of mob progression, etc.)
-----------
Bark given when skinning tree
