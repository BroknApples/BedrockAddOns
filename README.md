-----------
ND -   (Placeable Animal Trophy for finding all animals?)
ND - Deer (Forests of all types | Drops meat & antlers that can be turned into bone meal or some like headpiece and wall ornament)
ND - Bear- (spawn with certain chance near natural honey trees | or perhaps just in forests maybe specific ones | If special lie down and fight back traits not possible, then give them honey to chill em out)
ND -   Brown Bear (Lie Down, If you crouch and stop moving, it chills out, otherwise nah ur dead)

Existing Friendly/Neutral Mob Tweaks TODO:
-----------
ND - Polar Bears almost always aggressive and move a lot faster
ND - Dead tamed animals drop their collar with their name on it as a memento
-----------
ND - Hostile Mob Progression System:
-----------
Mobs Progress based on either days played or how far you have progressed
(gone to nether, gone to end, got diamond, beat wither?, beat end dragon? or something)
Chooseable option with a little add-on options item, default will be day based maybe
could even make the mobs spawn based on the closest player's items and tool's "points" - create point
system for every single attack item + its enchants and add ranges if bedrock allows for it

----------------------------------------------------------
MISC
